#Data Source for Week 1

Due to ongoing issues with Facebook/Instagram API access and login restrictions, I simulated an Ontario based Instagram like dataset using realistic captions and post dates tagged with common cities. The data reflects emotional tones such as gratitude, loneliness, joy, and isolation.

This will allow me to proceed with text preprocessing, weak labeling, and model training in Week 2 without delays.
